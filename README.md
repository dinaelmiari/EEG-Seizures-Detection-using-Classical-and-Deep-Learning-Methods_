# EEG Seizure Detection Using Classical and Deep Learning Methods

## 🧠 Overview

This project develops a pipeline for **automatic seizure detection** from multichannel EEG signals.
It combines **classical machine learning** (PCA, CSP, SVM, XGBoost) with **deep learning (CNN)** to analyze spatial and temporal brain patterns and identify seizure events.

## 📊 Dataset Description

* **Total segments:** 3546 EEG samples
* **Channels:** 23
* **Timepoints per sample:** 256
* **Labels:** Seizure / Non-seizure

Each segment represents a short EEG window, sampled at 256 Hz.


## ⚙️ Preprocessing

* **Noise filtering:** Bandpass filter (1–70 Hz)
* **Standardization:** Mean–variance normalization per channel
* **Dimensionality reduction:** PCA applied after flattening each EEG sample (23 × 256 → 5888 features)

## 🧩 Methods and Pipelines

### 1. **PCA and Logistic Regression**

* PCA reduced the 5888-dimensional data to 302 components (90% variance).
* Logistic Regression on top of PCs achieved ~53.5% accuracy.
* PCA visualization revealed overlapping classes but meaningful temporal-spatial trends.

---

### 2. **Covariance + PCA + SVM**

* Built 23 × 23 covariance matrices per sample to capture spatial relationships.
* PCA reduced these features, and an SVM classifier achieved **AUC = 0.763**.
* PCA components revealed seizure-related global correlations.

---

### 3. **GModPCA + SVM**

* PCA applied **individually per channel**, then combined.
* Achieved **AUC = 0.751** with 2 components per channel.

---

### 4. **ICA-GMod + XGBoost**

* Independent Component Analysis (ICA) extracted independent temporal sources per channel.
* SVM achieved AUC = 0.748; replacing it with **XGBoost** improved to **AUC = 0.867**.
* Demonstrated the power of nonlinear models for EEG data.

---

### 5. **Hybrid CNN + Statistical Features**

* EEG reshaped to (23 × 256 × 1) and fed into a CNN.
* Extracted 5 statistical features per channel: mean, std, max, min, and power.
* CNN captured spatio-temporal dependencies.
* Achieved **88.45% accuracy** and **0.9520 ROC AUC** — the best among all models.

## 🧭 Interpretability & Analysis

### 🧠 Spatial Importance (Occlusion Analysis)

* Each EEG channel was zeroed out to test its impact on accuracy.
* **Most informative channels:** 19, 21, 15, 2
* **Least informative channels:** 7, 5, 8, 17

### 🕒 Temporal Discrimination

* A sliding window (size = 64 samples) revealed that **timepoints 50–150** are most informative for seizure detection.

### 🔥 CSP + SVM Pipeline

* Common Spatial Pattern (CSP, 4 components) → StandardScaler → SVM (RBF kernel).
* Achieved **80.14% accuracy** and **81.42% F1-score**.
* CSP heatmaps showed highest contribution from channels 9 and 16.
* Temporal CSP analysis confirmed discriminative activity in the middle of the trial (~sample 128).
